### Adding an app to Splunk

In the next excersize I added an app to Splunk using Splunkbase

After creating an account, I downloaded *Sysmon App for Splunk*

> From the main page you go to settings | "Install app from File" |  Browse for the file and Upload
> Splunk must Restart to complete the update

Then I adjusted the Macros to ensure events are loaded.
